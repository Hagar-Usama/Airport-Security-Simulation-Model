# Airport-Security-Simulation-Model
Airport Security Simulation model with simulink, performance evaluation course

> make sure - when installing matlab - it has simulink and simevent

> in simulink:
    * Entity Generator: mean = arrival rate
    * Server: mean = response time/job (not rate)

## Todo 
* [x] build independent M/M/1 model
* [x] build independent M/M/m model
* [ ] build zone A
* [ ] build zone B1
* [ ] build zone B2
* [ ] build zone B3
* [ ] build zone C
* [ ] build zone D
* [ ] check other requirements
